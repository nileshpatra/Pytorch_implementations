# Pytorch_implementations

--This repository will contain all the implemented datasets in PyTorch by me-- 

It includes :

 1. Basic Xor implementation
 2. MNIST dataset analysis
 3. Pytorch classifier for cats and dogs
 
 Note : epochs are kept low because of the overwhelming computation power and time required for training.
